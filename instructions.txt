Your boss has given you the following project to fix for a client. It's supposed
to be a simple dice game, where the object of the game is to correctly add up
the values of the dice for 6 consecutive turns.

The issue is that a former programmer worked on it who didn't know how to debug
effectively. It's now up to you to clean up this code and add tests.

To run the program, type the following in your terminal:

```shell
python main.py
``` 

Follow the instructions in the README file to work through fixing the bugs and
adding test cases.

When you're done, fill out the following:

What bugs/issues did you fix in the code? List as bullet points below.
  Example: The input for a user asked to play again now is parsed correctly,
  and if a user's input is invalid it re-prompts the user.
* 

What tests did you add? List at least three behaviors you are checking for.
  Example: All dice have values between 1 and 6 (inclusive).
*
